# Hi there! üëã

I'm a passionate software developer with a solid background in building scalable web applications and solving complex problems. My journey in software development started several years ago, and I've had the pleasure of working with a variety of technologies and frameworks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, C#
- **Front-end**: React, Angular, Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express, Django, Spring Boot
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest, Mocha, JUnit, Selenium

## üöÄ Experience

I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to understand the full stack of web applications. My recent projects include a real-time chat application built with React and Socket.io, and a RESTful API for an e-commerce platform using Node.js and Express. I thrive in agile environments, where I can collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver value to our customers.

## üíº Approach to Development

I believe in clean code and the importance of code reviews for maintaining high-quality standards. I'm a strong advocate for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, which help streamline the development process and reduce deployment risks. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and methodologies to enhance productivity and efficiency in my work.

## üìö Interests

When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, exploring open-source projects, or participating in hackathons. I'm also passionate about sharing knowledge and mentoring budding developers in the community.
